## Purpose

The primary goal of the MLEngine suite is to create high-performance and versatile machine learning engines in Rust. Rust is known for its safety and performance characteristics, making it an excellent choice for implementing machine learning algorithms. This project offers a standardized and optimized approach to developing machine learning solutions.

Additionally, we understand the importance of interoperability with popular Python machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. To ensure that our Rust-based engines can seamlessly integrate with these frameworks, we have designed a testing framework that employs shell scripts. This allows for rigorous and automated testing of the engines' compatibility with Python, ensuring a smooth experience for users who want to leverage the power of Rust in their machine learning projects.

## Features

- **Rust-Based Engines**: The MLEngine suite provides a collection of machine learning engines implemented in Rust, optimized for performance and safety.

- **Integration Testing**: We offer a comprehensive testing framework for validating the compatibility of Rust-based engines with popular Python machine learning frameworks. This ensures that our engines can be seamlessly integrated into Python-based workflows.

- **Versatile Machine Learning Algorithms**: The suite includes various machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, making it a versatile choice for your projects.

- **Extensible**: The codebase is designed to be modular and easily extendable, allowing you to add your own machine learning algorithms or integrate with other libraries as needed.

- **Documentation**: We provide comprehensive documentation to help users and contributors understand the codebase, algorithms, and testing procedures.
